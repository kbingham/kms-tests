Building and Installing
-----------------------

The du-tests suite is written in Python and doesn't have any build time
dependency. To install it, run

	make install INSTALL_DIR=/path/to/target/directory

This will copy the test scripts to the target directory to be copied or
exported to the host.


--------------------
Runtime Dependencies
--------------------

The tests scripts require the following dependencies to be installed on the
target.

* Python 3
* kmsxx Python bindings (https://github.com/tomba/kmsxx.git)

kmsxx hasn't released any stable version yet, it is recommended to use the
latest master branch from the git repository.


-----------------
Running the Tests
-----------------

The test scripts are named kms-test-*.py. They can be run directly from the
test suite root directory.
